Implementation of an NFT contract and NFT-Auction in Polkadot (ink!) and Cosmwasm.

Based on contracts from solidity by example:

- https://solidity-by-example.org/app/erc721/
- https://solidity-by-example.org/app/english-auction/

The contracts have been simplified and aligned to contain similar functionality.
There can be small differences, but they shouldn't have a major impact on the code line count.
